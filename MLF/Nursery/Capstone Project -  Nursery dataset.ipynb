    "### Problem Statement: \n",
    "This is a classification problem. The dataset contains information about occupation of parents and child's nursery, family structure and financial standing, and social and health picture of the family. We need to train the model and given a new dataset we need to classify whether the child is not_recommended, recommended, very_recommended, priority and spec_priority. It solves the problem of figuring out what prerequisites are needed for a child's application to be accepted by the Nursery school. The advantage of using my trained model will help parents realize what are the problems that must avoided when applying for a Nursery school.\n",
